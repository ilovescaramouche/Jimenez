      <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
      <p>Through this lesson, I learned how important CSS is in making a website look neat and attractive. I used to think HTML was enough to build a webpage, but now I understand that CSS gives it life through design, color, and layout. It was interesting to see how one CSS file can control the style of many pages, which saves time and makes everything look consistent. I also learned about the three layers of a webpage which are the content, presentation, and behavior layers, and how each one works together to create a complete and interactive site. This lesson made me appreciate how much creativity and detail go into web design and it inspired me to keep learning more about how websites are made.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Lesson 2</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned how CSS brings life, color, and structure to a webpage by blending creativity with logic. I discovered how selectors, properties, and values work together to control how every element is displayed, and how small changes can completely transform the look of a page. I also learned about the three types of CSS which are external, embedded, and inline, and how each one serves a unique purpose in designing a webpage. External style sheets can change the appearance of multiple pages at once, embedded styles can give a single page its own look, and inline styles can be used for small and specific edits. I realized that CSS is not just about decorating a page but about organizing it and making it more expressive. This lesson helped me appreciate how coding can be both technical and artistic, and how even simple lines of code can create something beautiful, meaningful, and full of character. </p>

      <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned how CSS allows designers to bring structure, creativity, and consistency to web pages through different types of style sheets. I discovered that inline, internal, and external CSS each serve different but equally important roles in web design. Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag, and it is best used for quick, specific changes to a single element without affecting others. Internal CSS, which is written inside the head section of a webpage, affects all the elements within that page and is useful when giving one webpage its own unique look. External CSS, on the other hand, is stored in a separate file and can be linked to multiple pages, making it the most efficient and organized way to maintain a consistent style throughout an entire website. I also learned about the display property, which defines whether an element appears as a block or inline, influencing how the layout is arranged. The lesson also introduced the div and span tags, which act as containers that group or highlight parts of a webpage, allowing for more creative and flexible design. Through this lesson, I realized that CSS is not only about adding color or style but about creating order, personality, and harmony within a webpage. It taught me how design and logic work hand in hand to turn simple code into something functional and beautiful. </p>

      <h2>Lesson 4</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned how CSS rules, classes, and selectors work together to build the foundation of a well-designed and organized webpage. I discovered that a CSS rule is made up of a selector and a declaration, which defines how elements should appear. Each property and value combination serves a purpose, affecting everything from fonts and colors to spacing and layout. I also learned how classes act as reusable styles that can be applied to multiple elements, making it easier to maintain consistency throughout a design. What fascinated me most was the flexibility of classes, since a single element can have more than one class, allowing for layered and customized styles. I also understood how element plus class selectors make the design more specific by applying styles only to a certain type of element, which gives the designer more control and precision. Grouping selectors, on the other hand, makes the code cleaner and simpler, helping avoid repetition while still achieving the same result. This lesson made me appreciate how CSS is both logical and creative, a language that combines structure and artistry. It taught me that even small lines of code can bring a webpage to life when used thoughtfully, and that design is not just about what looks good but also about how well everything is organized and connected. </p>

<section>
      <h2>Lesson 5</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned about CSS selectors and how they allow designers to target and style specific parts of a webpage. I discovered that selectors are the foundation of CSS because they determine which elements will be affected by a style rule. The element selector applies a style to all instances of a specific HTML tag, while the class selector is used to apply the same design to multiple elements that share the same class. The ID selector, on the other hand, is meant for unique elements that only appear once on a page, like a header or footer. I also learned about the universal selector, which applies styles to all elements at once, and the group selector, which helps simplify code by combining multiple elements that share the same style. The attribute selector was also interesting because it allows styling elements based on their attributes, giving designers precise control. Through this lesson, I realized that CSS selectors make design more efficient and organized by letting us style exactly what we want without affecting the rest of the page. It showed me that web design is not only about appearance but also about strategy and structure, where every choice in code contributes to both function and beauty. </p>

<section>
      <h2>Lesson 6</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned how CSS can control the size, visibility, and interactivity of elements on a webpage, helping designers make their sites more organized and engaging. I discovered that properties like width, height, min-width, and max-height can change how a page looks and fits together, which makes it easier to design layouts that are neat and balanced. I also learned about visibility and how it can hide or show elements without completely removing them, which helps in arranging the content more effectively. What I found most interesting was the topic about pseudo-classes because they make a webpage feel more alive. I learned about the order of link, visited, hover, and active, and how each one controls the way a link changes when a user interacts with it. The hover effect especially caught my attention because it makes websites more interactive and fun to explore. Through this lesson, I realized that CSS is not just about colors and fonts but also about how users experience a webpage. It showed me that even small details in code can change how people feel when browsing a site, and that thoughtful design is about both creativity and purpose. </p>
